# Todo App

Todo App is an application built with React.js and Material UI, to manage a list of tasks. It can add, edit and delete new tasks, and toggle them between pending and done. It can also create, edit and delete lables, and assign each task to one or more to help the user filter through the list.

### Installation

After cloning the repository, run `yarn` to install neccesary dependencies. You can then run `yarn dev` to run the app locally.
